# Decorator Design Pattern

## Overview

The **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add new behaviors and responsibilities to objects without modifying their code. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality by wrapping objects with decorator classes.

## Purpose

The Decorator Pattern enables you to:
- Add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently
- Extend functionality without creating an explosion of subclasses
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle by dividing functionality into separate classes
- Compose behaviors at runtime rather than compile-time
- Keep classes focused on their core responsibilities

## Architecture

### Key Participants

1. **Component (Interface)** - Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them
2. **ConcreteComponent** - The original object to which additional responsibilities can be attached
3. **Decorator (Abstract)** - Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface conforming to Component's interface
4. **ConcreteDecorator** - Adds specific responsibilities to the component by wrapping it

### Structure

```
Client ‚Üí Component Interface ‚Üê ConcreteComponent
                            ‚Üê Decorator ‚Üí ConcreteDecoratorA
                                       ‚Üí ConcreteDecoratorB
```

Decorators wrap the component and can be stacked to combine multiple behaviors.

## How It Works

### Core Concept

The pattern works through composition and delegation:
- Each decorator **has-a** component (holds a reference to it)
- Each decorator **is-a** component (implements the same interface)
- Decorators delegate calls to the wrapped component and add their own behavior before or after

### Stacking Decorators

Multiple decorators can be chained together:
```
ConcreteDecoratorB ‚Üí ConcreteDecoratorA ‚Üí ConcreteComponent
```

Each decorator adds its layer of functionality, creating a powerful composition mechanism.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Adding Visual Effects
Enhance UI components with borders, scrollbars, shadows, or other visual elements without modifying the original component.

### 2. Adding Behaviors to Streams
Wrap input/output streams with buffering, encryption, compression, or encoding capabilities.

### 3. Middleware and Filters
Add logging, authentication, caching, or validation layers to requests and responses in web applications.

### 4. Text Processing
Add formatting, encoding, or transformation capabilities to text outputs (bold, italic, uppercase, etc.).

### 5. Feature Toggling
Dynamically enable or disable features by wrapping objects with feature-specific decorators.

### 6. Notifications
Extend notification systems with multiple channels (email, SMS, push notifications) by stacking decorators.

## Advantages

‚úÖ **Flexibility** - Add or remove responsibilities at runtime  
‚úÖ **Single Responsibility** - Each decorator handles one specific concern  
‚úÖ **Open/Closed Principle** - Extend functionality without modifying existing code  
‚úÖ **Composability** - Mix and match decorators to create custom combinations  
‚úÖ **Avoids Class Explosion** - No need to create subclasses for every combination  
‚úÖ **Transparency** - Decorators are invisible to clients using the Component interface

## Disadvantages

‚ö†Ô∏è **Complexity** - Many small objects can make the system harder to understand  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Order Dependency** - The order of decorators matters and can affect behavior  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Debugging Difficulty** - Multiple wrapped layers can complicate troubleshooting  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Identity Issues** - A decorated component is not identical to the original  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Overhead** - Setting up decorator chains requires careful planning

## Decorator vs. Inheritance

### Inheritance Approach
- Static - defined at compile-time
- Affects all instances of a class
- Can lead to class explosion with multiple combinations
- Rigid and hard to change

### Decorator Approach
- Dynamic - configured at runtime
- Affects individual objects
- Flexible composition of behaviors
- Easy to add or remove responsibilities
- More maintainable and extensible

## When to Use

Consider the Decorator Pattern when you need to:
- Add responsibilities to individual objects without affecting others
- Avoid an explosion of subclasses for every feature combination
- Extend functionality of classes that you cannot modify (third-party libraries)
- Compose behaviors dynamically at runtime
- Keep classes focused on single responsibilities
- Support withdrawal of added responsibilities

## When NOT to Use

Avoid the Decorator Pattern when:
- Simple inheritance is sufficient for your needs
- You need to modify the core behavior rather than extend it
- The order of operations doesn't matter (consider composition instead)
- Performance is critical and the wrapping overhead is unacceptable

## Real-World Applications

### Java I/O Streams
The Java I/O library extensively uses decorators:
- BufferedInputStream wraps FileInputStream
- DataInputStream adds data reading capabilities
- GZIPInputStream adds compression
- Multiple decorators can be chained together

### GUI Frameworks
UI components can be decorated with:
- Borders
- Scrollbars
- Shadows
- Tooltips
- Event handlers

### Web Applications
HTTP requests and responses are decorated with:
- Logging middleware
- Authentication filters
- Compression handlers
- CORS headers
- Rate limiting

### Pizza Ordering System
A classic example where a base pizza is decorated with:
- Different toppings (cheese, pepperoni, vegetables)
- Different crusts (thin, thick, stuffed)
- Each decorator adds cost and description

## Key Differences from Similar Patterns

### Decorator vs. Proxy
- **Decorator**: Adds new responsibilities to objects
- **Proxy**: Controls access to objects
- Both use composition, but serve different purposes

### Decorator vs. Adapter
- **Decorator**: Enhances functionality with the same interface
- **Adapter**: Changes the interface to make it compatible
- Decorator extends, Adapter converts

### Decorator vs. Composite
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to a single object
- **Composite**: Treats groups of objects uniformly
- Both use recursive composition but for different goals

## Implementation Considerations

### Interface Consistency
All decorators and the component must share the same interface to ensure transparency to clients.

### Keeping Decorators Lightweight
Each decorator should add one specific responsibility. Avoid creating "god decorators" that do too much.

### Order Matters
The sequence in which decorators are applied can significantly affect the final behavior. Document the expected order clearly.

### Abstract Decorator Class
Using an abstract decorator base class can reduce code duplication when multiple decorators share common behavior.

## Key Takeaways

üîë Decorator wraps an object to add new behaviors dynamically  
üîë Both decorator and component implement the same interface  
üîë Multiple decorators can be stacked for combined functionality  
üîë Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing  
üîë Follows Open/Closed Principle - open for extension, closed for modification  
üîë Perfect for adding cross-cutting concerns without modifying core logic  
üîë Order of decoration matters and affects the final behavior

## Design Principles Supported

- **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each decorator handles one specific concern
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Decorators depend on abstractions, not concrete classes
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favors object composition over class inheritance
